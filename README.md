DEEP_SPACE COMMUNICATION
Inspiration - ISRO's Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3, Starship(NASA)

Main Problems 
 - Software issues(60-70%)
      + Resource : General Trends in Aerospace Engineering and ISRO's reported (11 are peacefull out of 423)
      + Main targets - Doppler effect, cosmic noise effect, battery shift, signal degradation, synchronise encryption
      + We uses data verifires(3-step encrpt) to solve the software glitches    
 
 - Making Good Connection with Source & Dest
      + 
     

What we do ?
  - Solving the errors which occurs in software
  - Creating data verifiers (3-step encrypt) to find out gliches based on the Big data datasets

What if ?
  - Hardware of the given software isn't working so 

why ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 fails ?
  - connection lost due to software glitch
  + Would you know chandryan-2 has some advanced remote monitoring if connection isn't failed so it can leads to soft landing

Hardware Issues ?
 - Hardware Failures (20-30%)
 - There are many solution there to solve the hardware issues  FDI (Fault Detection Isolation & Recovery Protocol) and redundancy protocol
 - Uses Ground control and remote monitoring , automated recovery & self healing system
 - But there are many solution of Hardware issues. so ,we can use big data about those solution !!

Note 
 - Space data transmission   Image -- Binary -- Encrypt
