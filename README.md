## Main Problems

### **Software Issues (60-70%)**
- **Resource**: General trends in aerospace engineering and ISRO's reported data (e.g., 11 peaceful missions out of 423).  
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Doppler effect impact on signal frequency.
  - Cosmic noise interference during transmission.
  - Battery shift causing power fluctuations.
  - Signal degradation over long distances.
  - Synchronization of encrypted data transmissions.

- **Solutions**:
  - **Data Verifiers**: A 3-step encryption process to detect and resolve software glitches.
  - Big Data Analysis: Utilizing extensive datasets to predict and mitigate errors.

### **Making a Good Connection Between Source & Destination**
- Establishing stable communication links involves tackling:
  - Interference from cosmic noise.
  - Real-time data synchronization.
  - Strengthening weak signal transmission over vast distances.

## Why Chandrayaan-2's Landing Attempt Failed?
- **Reason**: Connection lost due to a software glitch.  
- **Potential Outcome**: Advanced remote monitoring could have enabled a soft landing if the connection was sustained.

---

## **Hardware Issues (20-30%)**
- **Challenges**:
  - Component failures due to stress or cosmic conditions.
  - System-level errors affecting mission-critical operations.

- **Solutions**:
  - Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) Protocols.
  - Redundancy and automated recovery systems.
  - Leveraging Big Data insights for predictive hardware issue resolution.

## Note
- **Space Data Transmission Workflow**:
  1. **Image Data** → Converted to Binary Code.
  2. **Binary Code** → Encrypted for secure transmission.
  3. **Decryption & Processing** → Ensuring accurate data retrieval.
